Thank you for choosing to use Der Hund (“the App”). Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy outlines our approach to user privacy, specifically highlighting that the App does not collect, store, or share any personal data.

### No Collection of Personal Data

We do not collect, store, or process any personal data. The App is designed to function entirely offline, utilizing a locally stored dictionary to provide word lookups. Since the App does not access or use any personal data, there is no need for data collection or storage.

### No Network Connections

The App does not require or initiate any network connections. All functionalities of the App are performed locally on your device without any communication with external servers or the internet.
### No Permissions Required

The App does not request or require any special permissions to access your device's hardware, software, or data. It operates independently and does not interact with other applications or services on your device.

### No Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with or use any third-party services, trackers, or analytics tools. Since the App operates completely offline, no data is transmitted to or from third-party entities.
### Changes to This Privacy Policy

Although our Privacy Policy is unlikely to change due to the nature of the App, we reserve the right to update this policy if necessary. If any changes are made, we will update the effective date at the top of this document. Rest assured, any changes will continue to uphold our commitment to not collecting or using personal data.
